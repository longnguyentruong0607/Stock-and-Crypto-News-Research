       "' After a bullish day for Bitcoin and the majors on Wednesday, it’s been a broadly bullish Wednesday morning. At the time of writing, Bitcoin, BTC to USD, was up by 3.75% to $43,086.1. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to an early morning low $41,432.0 before making a move. Steering clear of the first major support level at $40,687, Bitcoin rallied to a mid-morning current day high $43,860. Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $42,489 and the 38.2% FIB of $41,592. The early rally saw Bitcoin also break through the second major resistance level at $43,449 before revising sub-$43,000 levels. It has been a mixed morning for the broader crypto market. At the time of writing, Polkadot was down by 1.61% to buck the morning trend. It’s been a bullish morning for the rest of the majors, however. Chainlink (+3.92%), Ethereum (+3.81%), and Litecoin (+4.11%) set the morning pace. Binance Coin (+1.39%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+2.04%), Cardano’s ADA (+0.84%), Crypto.com Coin (+2.99%), and Ripple’s XRP (+1.07%) trailed the front runners, however. Through the early hours, the crypto total market cap fell to an early morning low $1,854bn before rising to a high $1,951bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $1,912bn. Bitcoin’s dominance fell to an early morning low 42.00% before rising to a high 42.44%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 42.39%. Bitcoin would need to avoid a fall back through the first major resistance level at $42,489 to bring $44,000 levels back into play. Support from the broader market will be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break back through the second major resistance level at $43,449. Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, the second major resistance level and morning high $43,860.0 would likely cap any upside. In the event of an extended rally through the afternoon, Bitcoin could test resistance at $45,000 before any pullback. The third major resistance level sits at $45,251. A fall back through the first major resistance level and through the 38.2% FIB of $41,592 would bring the first major support'"

GameStop\\'s stock is also among the laggards of the popular meme stock group this month — AMC\\'s stock has gained 8.5% and Clover Health has tacked on nearly 5%. BlackBerry\\'s stock is down 8% on the month.\\xa0 GameStop shares are down 46% since hitting a record high on Jan. 27. The pullback in GameStop stock — at least as far as September goes — coincides with several factors.\\xa0 First, the stock appears to be receiving less love on the WallStreetBets Reddit platform that made it an icon of retail investors to kick off the year.\\xa0 The stock has seen plunging popularity among Redditors since mid-August, according to data analyzed by Yahoo Finance from social media monitoring site Swaggystocks. Meanwhile, internet mentions of GameStop have crashed since mid-August.\\xa0 One could hypothesize the meme trader crowd may be punishing GameStop\\'s new executive chairman and big backer, Ryan Cohen, for a failure to issue a clear turnaround plan. Recent financial results likely haven\\'t helped market sentiment, either.\\xa0 This month, the company posted an adjusted loss per share of 76 cents vs. a Wall Street estimate of 67 cents with revenue of $1.18 billion, compared to $1.12 billion expected. Sales rose 25.6% from a year ago on the back of demand for new gaming consoles from Sony and Microsoft. The company also highlighted increased costs in transforming into a tech company, as one culprit for the steep loss.\\xa0 New GameStop CEO Matt Furlong took no questions on his first earnings call as CEO and shared zero information regarding its business plan. Not exactly ideal for a stock that continues to trade on hope more than any semblance of fundamentals.\\xa0 \"GameStop\\'s [stock] is already trading over two times next year\\'s enterprise value to',\n",
       "  ' High-profile investor and early meme stock bull Michael Burry, known for his depiction in the film \"The Big Short,\" said on Twitter last week that he had received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission tied to the agency\\'s investigation of GameStop (GME).\\xa0\\xa0 Some recent trading woes have also proven a headwind for the meme stock frenzy. Many of the original meme stocks — including GameStop, AMC Entertainment (AMC), and BlackBerry (BB) — fell in trading on Wednesday.\\xa0 But institutional investors are still taking notice of the rise of retail trading. In a new interview, Suzanne Shank — the president and CEO of investment bank Siebert Williams Shank — said retail investing is \"here to stay,\" even as she cautioned about the herd mentality that can drive such trading. \"As a firm, we don\\'t sell directly to retail,\" says Shank, who spoke to Yahoo Finance on Sept. 16. \"But obviously as a market participant, we see the impact of retail, which has been quite significant.\" \"The question is whether — all of them — they seem to run in packs and move together and pile on, as opposed to making the same measured investment decisions that institutions do,\" adds. \"But there\\'s no doubt that the retail factor is here to stay, and it\\'s going to play a significant role in how stocks move around on a daily basis,\" she says. Off-exchange trading made up 47.2% of total U.S. equity trading volume in January 2021, an increase from 41.5% last year and 37.3% over the same month in 2019, according to an analysis conducted by the trade association SIFMA.\\xa0 In earnings released last month, trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) reported 22.5 million user accounts with money in them, a 130% spike from 9.8 million in the same quarter last year.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to the 5 Best Short Squeeze Stocks To Buy Now. The retail investor frenzy at the stock market and the short squeeze saga involving GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC) at the beginning of this year has resulted in a lot of interest in stocks with high short interest. The main battle, between retail investors and hedge funds, has resulted in billions of dollars in losses for hedge funds. Data from S3 Partners, a New York-based market intelligence firm, shows that GameStop short-sellers have lost $7.3 billion so far this year. The losses for AMC short-sellers this year also stand close, clocking in at around $4.5 billion, the market intelligence firm estimates. A short squeeze happens when the share price of an equity rises unexpectedly and short-sellers, who have money riding on the stock to lose value, try to exit their short positions to limit losses. Some of the stocks with high short interest presently include Katapult Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:KPLT), Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (NASDAQ:BGFV), and Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ICPT), among others.  The interaction hubs of retail investors, like social media platform Reddit, have sparked a lot of interest on Wall Street in recent months as hedge funds track Reddit forums to keep abreast of latest developments around stocks with high short interest. Financial services firm IHS Markit, in a study published earlier this year, revealed that the most-shorted stocks on the market in January this year outperformed the least-shorted ones by a factor of close to 24%. It seems like retail investors are slowly transforming overall market dynamics in their favor.  The entire hedge fund industry is feeling the reverberations of the changing financial landscape. Its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade, during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance',\n",
       "  ' RF Capital Management LLC, an investment management firm, published its second-quarter 2021 investor letter – a copy of which can be downloaded here. A net return of 55.17% was recorded by the fund for the first half of 2021. The fund has gotten off to a strong start this year – especially in the first quarter where it generated a 42.82% return net of all fees. You can take a look at the fund’s top 5 holdings to have an idea about their top bets for 2021. In the Q2 2021 investor letter of RF Capital Management, the fund mentioned GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and discussed its stance on the firm. GameStop Corp. is a Grapevine, Texas-based electronics retail company with a $15.5 billion market capitalization. GME delivered a 977.81% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 2,764.03%. The stock closed at $203.40 per share on September 13, 2021. Here is what RF Capital Management has to say about GameStop Corp. in its Q2 2021 investor letter: \"Although the initial trading frenzy has passed, the stock price continues to remain elevated as we write this letter. We don’t profess to understand the mechanics and exact details of what drove GameStop’s historic run. However, we did trade around our position in GME as it happened and took full advantage of the price action. Because GME has been well-covered in the media, we’ll just provide a brief overview of what happened. GameStop’s stock price started the year at $19/share. Then volume started to increase midJanuary, and the stock traded in the $30’s and $40’s. In the last week of January, the meteoric rise of GME’s stock price occurred. GME’s stock reached an all-time high of $483 before crashing back down to the $40’s. Essentially, the stock price rallied 2,442%, crashed (wiping out almost $30 billion in market cap), and rallied again. The prevailing narrative was the battle between retail investors versus institutions and hedge funds. Retail investors were participating in forums and social media sites like WallStreetBets on Reddit and Twitter to exchange ideas.',\n",
       "  ' GameStop Corp. GME has been quite proactive about undertaking efforts to strengthen digital operations. With consumers’ growing inclination toward online shopping, the company has been evolving itself into a strong and digitally advanced player in the gaming industry. Progressing on these lines, the company announced plans to hire nearly 500 employees at its customer service center in Pembroke Pines, FL. Let’s take a closer look at this latest development as well as other efforts undertaken by the company. In its last earnings call, GameStop had informed about entering into a lease for a new customer care center in Pembroke Pines, as it continues to build on customer care operations in the United States. Investment to boost employee strength at this facility is likely to reinforce the company’s U.S.-based customer care operations. This newly-leased service center is expected to be operational by the end of 2021.GameStop has been striving to build upon its digital capabilities, especially since the middle of last year when Ryan Cohen began taking interests in the company. RC Ventures, which is managed by Ryan Cohen, is one of the largest stakeholders of GameStop. Under the leadership of Ryan Cohen, the company has been undertaking radical digital transformation efforts. It has been restructuring its board and formed a Strategic Planning and Capital Allocation committee. Since the formation of this committee, the company has appointed several board executives with significant experience in e-commerce, customer care, technology, UI, UX, operations and supply chain.Expanding fulfillment network and e-commerce services has been a vital part of the company’s transformation efforts. In July, 2021, the company entered into a lease for a 530,000-square feet facility in Reno, NV, which is expected to be in operation this year. Prior to this, the company entered into a lease for a 700,000-square feet facility in York, PA. The facility began shipping orders during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Owing to these expansions, the company’s fulfillment network now spans across both coasts of Continental U.S.The company’s strategic deal with Microsoft, to provide customers with enhanced digital solutions, is also noteworthy. GameStop utilizes Microsoft’s cloud solutions',\n",
       "  'It looks like investors of GameStop (NYSE: GME) are in for a rocky end to the week after the video game retailer released their Q2 earnings report last night. Despite revenue topping expectations and coming in 25% higher than where it was the same time last year, shares of the Texas headquartered company still dipped more than 10% in after-hours trading. The fact that EPS was a little light compared to what analysts had been expecting didn’t help, though the GAAP EPS print of -$0.85 was still an improvement on Q1. The company’s sales for the quarter were also up 25% year over year with each of the three core segments (hardware and accessories, software, collectibles) coming in ahead of expectations.  In their address to shareholders, management was keen to make it clear that they’re investing in long-term growth initiatives such as the expansion of their product catalog, improved fulfillment capabilities, and enhanced talent. The $1.8 billion in cash that GameStop ended the quarter with will go a long way in helping their initiatives bear dividends. Despite the strong fundamental movement, management maintained the company’s suspension of forward guidance, but it’s fair to think that like last quarter they “believe total net sales is the most appropriate metric to evaluate performance at this time”. If investors adhere to this logic, then GameStop is going in the right direction. So what does this mean for the direction GameStop shares will go in once the immediate reaction to last night’s numbers is over? A look at their performance so far this year yields some clues. We probably all remember the headlines they garnered back in January and February with their Reddit-fuelled short squeeze, but they’ve remained impressively buoyant since, even as their daily trading volume has normalized. After jumping from $20 to almost $500 in less than a month they’d have been forgiven for retracing most of it, and while they did initially, since the end of February they’ve barely traded below $150. It could be said their chart is showing a dangerous triple top, made up of where shares tapped',\n",
       "  'Investors continue to eye moves in Treasury bond yields, funding debates in Washington  Written by Andrew Button at The Motley Fool Canada Meme stocks like AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) and GameStop (NYSE:GME) are in the news again thanks to a series of strange posts on a market maker’s Twitter account. On Tuesday, Citadel Securities made a series of posts about a controversy it had been involved in earlier in the year. In the posts, the company made the following claims: Citadel Securities did not pressure Robinhood (NYSE:HOOD) to restrict trading on GameStop shares. Citadel Securities CEO Ken Griffin had never spoken to Vlad Tenev personally. Citadel Securities was the “pre-eminent market maker” for retail investors in January. The posts caused quite a stir when they were published. On the same day, #KenGriffinLied trended on Twitter, as meme stock investors expressed doubt as to the veracity of Citadel Securities’s claims. Tweeters strongly questioned the claim that Ken Griffin had never spoken to Vlad Tenev. Many pointed out that Vlad had, in fact, spoken to one of Griffin’s lieutenants and had made comments implying that he was on a first name basis with Griffin himself. Citadel Securities received intense criticism in January and February when it was accused of having pressured Robinhood to restrict trading on meme stocks. In January, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said that market makers pressured his company to halt trading on GME, the most popular meme stock at the time. Citadel Securities is by far Robinhood’s largest market maker, receiving significant amounts of business from a payment for order flow (PFOF) arrangement. Robinhood works with several market makers, but Citadel Securities is the largest among them by volume. In January, it handled 50% of all GME trades. It appears possible, then, that Citadel Securities pressured Robinhood to halt the trades. It could have been one of Robinhood’s other market makers, but Citadel Securities, as the most influential among them, is a prime candidate. Citadel Securities, along with a handful of other market makers, is currently being sued for its role in the GameStop fiasco of January 2021. The',\n",

       "  ' GameStop\\'s GME, the prodigal son of retail equities amid the retail apocalypse, saw its shares dropped off a 10% cliff out of the gates Thursday morning following a rather disappointing earnings call the prior evening. GameStop missed EPS estimates by a mile, but the biggest disappointment was its lack of guidance regarding its ostensibly ambiguous \"transformation\" plan. However, this rational morning dip was quickly bought up by the seemingly irrational cohort of r/wallstreetbets (WSB) traders (though they did utilized its 50-day moving average, which became a technical support level). This group of nostalgic market-moving traders drove GameStop up thousands of percentage points this year, allowing the firm to raise over a billion in cash through seasoned equity offerings. However, as of now, it looks to be burning a hole in the company\\'s pocket, with an inability to turn a profit with its current business model and no guidance on a new approach. Ryan Cohen, the \\'visionary\\' activist investor with aspirations to drive growth back into this antiquated retailer, is yet to show investors how he plans to do so. With no plan in place, GameStop may run out of money before any operational shift can even be made. I would steer clear of this gambling apparatus. Value Buy On the other hand, Best Buy BBY had an excellent July quarter, blowing analysts\\' estimates out of the water and demonstrating another record set of Q2 results. Best Buy solidified its market control of consumer electronics in the retail space amid the pandemic, as its smaller (less liquid) competitors dropped out of the market. Best Buy has shown excellent operational efficiency in the past 12 months with double-digit sales growth that flowed down in a margin-expanding fashion to even more significant earnings growth. BBY just exhibited its largest operational margins in the stock’s over 2-decade history, with digital omnichannel options shaping up to be a strong profit driver. As the world went remote, there was a significant amount of pulled forward demand.

       "  'With the stock market pulling back sharply over the last few trading sessions, investors would probably expect a high beta technology stock like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) to be down significantly as well. That’s surprisingly not the case, as the electric vehicle company has been showing serious relative strength amidst market weakness. This could be a sign that Tesla is gearing up for an end-of-year rally, particularly when you consider the fact that the stock has been stuck in neutral for the majority of 2021. Although Tesla’s current valuation might raise some eyebrows among investors who are keen on fundamental analysis, the company’s unique brand and market-leading status in the EV industry still make it one of the most intriguing companies today. According to MarketBeat, there are even analysts out there bold enough to slap a $1200 price target on the stock, which implies the potential for massive upside. The truth is that Tesla might be one of the best stocks to consider buying in the S&P 500 at this time, and here are a few reasons why:  Sometimes, it pays to keep things simple when it comes to investing. We know how many governments and businesses are focusing on clean energy sources as an alternative to fossil fuels, and this trend is only going to gain momentum in the coming years. For example, consider the Biden Administration’s $7.5 billion plan to expand electric vehicle charging to underserved areas. That’s a huge reason why Tesla could deliver strong outperformance over the long term, as it’s a company that is disrupting both the automotive and power generation industries with cutting-edge clean energy technology. The global EV market is expected to reach an estimated $725 billion by 2026 and international markets like China and Europe are seeing huge demand for these vehicles. Tesla is well-positioned to expand internationally into these high-growth markets thanks to a gigafactory in Shanghai and a planned gigafactory in Berlin. Tesla is also investing heavily in R&D to reduce its manufacturing costs and improve its technology, which could at some point allow for the mass adoption of electric',\n",

After setting a new all-time high upon the S&P500 inclusion, the stock lost an incredible 40%. However, the recent price action has been very encouraging for bulls. As the stock marches to new highs, we will look at the current ownership structure in this article. See our latest analysis for Tesla. Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, explained the move to sell 180,000 TSLA shares as a cash-raising measure to boost the stake in UiPath (NYSE: PATH). Wood pointed out that TSLA remains the largest holding in her portfolio, confirming the bullish stance on the stock. Meanwhile, the company just obtained a patent for laser beam windshield wiper technology. From the current standpoint, it is hard to understand why anyone would potentially point a laser toward the driver. Still, a proper application of this technology is yet to be understood. In addition, Tesla also possesses a patent for electromagnetic wipers. The problems with automated driving are persistent as the latest Model 3 fatal crash in Florida prompted the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The agency officials have been following the application of autonomous driving technologies, already investigating 33 crashes involving Tesla vehicles with partially automated driver-assist systems. On a more positive note, Wedbush Securities issued a positive note, claiming that Tesla can get to 900k deliveries in 2021 and 1.3m in 2022. The data below shows that after the first half of 2021, the company still leads the global plug-in EV market. Wedbush has Tesla as “Outperform,” with a price target of US$1,000, which would be a new all-time high. With a market capitalization of US$752b, Tesla is relatively large.

Tesla has generally outperformed in the global rout hitting rate-sensitive investing styles, while ARKK posted one of its worst sessions in months on Tuesday. Meanwhile data overnight showed money managers withdrew $297 million from the growth-focused fund on Monday, the most since March, to bring the four-day outflow to more than $660 million. Since the Federal Reserve signaled last week a move to taper pandemic stimulus, Treasury yields have jumped and sent a shockwave through growth shares. Ark funds are heavily exposed to such names thanks to Wood’s focus on disruptive innovation and tech. Tesla remains Wood’s largest bet as the biggest holding for the flagship ARKK fund as well as the firm overall. She predicts its shares will rise from around $778 currently to $3,000. However, Ark often trims its stake in the carmaker when it has performed very well or grown too large in the portfolio. The carmaker was up 5.7% this month through Tuesday, compared with a 5.2% drop for the Nasdaq 100 tech gauge. ARKK was down 8.2%.

       "  ' Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) is scheduled to report its third-quarter delivery number later this week. Expectations are running higher after the electric vehicle giant reported record cumulative deliveries of over 386,000 vehicles in the first half of the year. Q3 Expectations For Tesla: With Tesla hinting at targeting 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multiyear time horizon, the company may have to clock in sales of about 750,000 in 2021 versus the 499,550 vehicles it delivered in 2020 to meet or exceed the target.\\xa0 This would leave the company shooting for 364,000 deliveries in the second half of the year. The Street\\'s Tesla Delivery Forecasts: Wall Street analysts are optimistic. The ballpark estimates of most analysts hovers around the magic number of 233,000 units for the third quarter. RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak estimates deliveries of 233,500 units, which would represent a 67% year-over-year increase. The analyst expects Model 3/Y deliveries of 223,476 units and Model S/X deliveries of 10,000 units. Regionally, Spak forecasts deliveries of 90,000 units in the U.S., 61,000 units in Europe, 66,476 units in China, 8,000 units in Canada and 8,000 units in the rest of the world. Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter raised his third-quarter delivery estimate for Tesla to 233,000, premised on reports of strong production. The analyst said he expects Tesla\\'s China market share to inflect higher in September thanks to a focus on domestic deliveries over exports. \"We think Q3 will be TSLA\\'s strongest quarter ever,\" he said.\\xa0 The chip shortage could prove to be a dampener if it all it impacts production, Potter said. Chinese EV peers Nio Inc. (NYSE: NIO) and Li Auto, Inc. (NASDAQ: LI)  tempered delivery forecasts on the basis of component and chip shortages.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the stock, go directly to Analyzing Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA): More Future Growth Catalysts, Hedge Fund Sentiment and Analyst Ratings. There is little doubt that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), the electric vehicle (EV) maker headquartered in California, has made giant strides in establishing itself as the biggest name in not only the EV space but also the automotive industry as a whole over the last decade. The company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has a market capitalization of $720 billion. Since the IPO in 2010, the stock has surged more than 20,000%. However, it is also one of the most high volume names on the market, a stock characteristic that often leads to price volatility.  After registering a record rally that lasted through most of last year - Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock price jumped more than 700% between February 2020 and February 2021 - the stock has been taking a breather since April on the back of concerns around slowing EV demand, a global chip shortage that has affected EV production, and a dramatic fall in the price of cryptocurrencies. The company is heavily invested in the new technology and reportedly bought more than $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin earlier this year.  Despite these concerns, some of which have been around for years, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has continued to consistently beat the market on growth, smash earnings expectations on Wall Street, and provide investors with record returns. For example, in earnings results for the second quarter, posted on July 26, the company reported earnings per share of $1.45, beating market predictions by $0.47. The revenue over the period was close to $12 billion, up 98% year-on-year and beating analyst estimates by $560 million.  The delivery numbers of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), which are often the subject of intense debate, have also been more than impressive. In the second quarter, the company reported 201,250 deliveries, up'],\n",

       "  ' Wasting no time, crypto bulls already see last week\\'s banishment of crypto trading by the Chinese government as a boon to the emerging sector. Speaking at Yahoo Finance\\'s Crypto Investing Summit this week, the investor and podcaster, Anthony Pompliano, echoed the sentiment of many longtime investors of the asset class.\\xa0 The Chinese government banned cryptocurrency activities at least 5 different times before last week, with this most recent action making crypto trading or offering any crypto-related services to Chinese citizens a financial crime. (Here\\'s the official statement from Chinese regulators.) Since the announcement, reports indicate that an exodus like what happened to the country\\'s crypto mining companies back in May is now underway for crypto companies in violation of the law.\\xa0 Two of the world\\'s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Huobi, both halted registrations for new China-based customers over the weekend.\\xa0 But Pompliano views the crackdown as a positive development, not only for the crypto sector but also for the U.S. economy. \"This is the most American technology that we have today, similar to the internet,\" Pompliano told Yahoo Finance. \"China is making a massive geopolitical mistake here. Now it\\'s up to the United States... If someone is going to benefit from this technology, we better make sure it\\'s us.\" After dropping from $45,000 on the news to just below $41,000, bitcoin – now hovering above $42,000 – and other major cryptocurrencies show signs of recovery. Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Ethereum (ETH-USD), Binance\\'s exchange coin BNB, and Solana (SOL1-USD) all show improvement over the last 24 hours, while Cardano (ADA-USD) and Ripple remain in the red. To be sure, all of these assets sold off at the beginning of the week. To assume the crypto sector will not see some price reflection from losing Chinese customers is wrong. In light of these concerns, however, geographic data from the blockchain analysis firm, Chainalysis, indicates that East Asia, a region which China dominates, already saw a decline in the growth of its crypto trading relative to other parts of the world.

It will hold the world\\'s two largest cryptocurrencies weighted by their market capitalization, which is around 67 per cent bitcoin and 33 per cent ethereum. For now, Evolve will do this by holding its bitcoin ETF (EBIT) and Ether ETF (ETHR) and rebalanced monthly. Bitcoin and ethereum make up around 65 per cent of the cryptocurrency market. \"Bitcoin has established itself as a store of value and is often referred to as digital gold,\" said Raj Lala, president and CEO, Evolve ETFs in a release. \"Ether is often referred to as digital oil and has become an essential building block for digital finance including NFTs and other DeFi applications.\" Combining the two can also help provide diversification. Though they often move in similar directions, performance has varied between bitcoin and ether. Evolve says in 2020, ether outperformed bitcoin by over 150 per cent. But ether was negative in 2019 while bitcoin was up 90 per cent. ETC is TFSA and RRSP-eligible and has no fee but the underlying funds charge 0.75 per cent annually plus applicable taxes. Price movements will be based on the U.S. dollar prices of bitcoin and ether. Evolve says it doesn\\'t plan for ETC to pay regular distributions.

Falling well short of the first major resistance level at $43,646, Bitcoin slid to a late morning intraday low $41,548. While steering clear of the first major support level at $41,425, Bitcoin tested support at the 38.2% FIB of $41,592. It has been a mixed morning for the broader crypto market. At the time of writing, Crypto.com Coin was down by 4.03% to lead the way down, with Cardano’s ADA (-0.02%) also joining Bitcoin in the red. It’s been a bullish morning for the rest of the majors, however. Chainlink and Bitcoin Cash SV were up by 2.63 and by 2.11% respectively to lead the way.

Support from the broader market will be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break out from the morning high $42,777.0. Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, the first major resistance level and resistance at $44,000 would likely cap any upside. In the event of an extended rally through the afternoon, Bitcoin could test resistance at $45,000 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $45,112.
